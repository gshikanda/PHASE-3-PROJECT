    "During this step, we'll evaluate the results of our modeling efforts. Does our model solve the problems that we outlined all the way back during step 1? Why or why not? Often times, evaluating the results of our modeling step will raise new questions, or will cause us to consider changing our approach to the problem. Notice from the CRISP-DM diagram above, that the \"Evaluation\" step is unique in that it points to both Business Understanding and Deployment. As we mentioned before, Data Science is an iterative process -- that means that given the new information our model has provided, we'll often want to start over with another iteration, armed with our newfound knowledge! Perhaps the results of our model showed us something important that we had originally failed to consider the goal of the project or the scope. Perhaps we learned that the model can't be successful without more data, or different data. Perhaps our evaluation shows us that we should reconsider our approach to cleaning and structuring the data, or how we frame the project as a whole (e.g. realizing we should treat the problem as a classification rather than a regression task). In any of these cases, it is totally encouraged to revisit the earlier steps."

If the project has proved successful, then you'll work with stakeholders to determine the best way to implement models and insights. For example, you might set up an automated ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines of raw data in order to feed into a database and reformat it so that it is ready for modeling. During the deployment step, you'll actively work to determine the best course of action for getting the results of your project into the wild, and you'll often be involved with building everything needed to put the software into production."
